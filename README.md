- Power BI
 
## SQL
## Project Steps:
### 1. Database Design:
- Identified the entities/tables and attributes/columns relevant to the fashion store (products, customers, orders, shippers, order details, categories, employee, suppliers)
- Designed an appropriate database schema using a relational model, considering
relationships, primary and foreign keys.

### 2. Data Collection and Loading:
- Loaded the data into the database using a suitable database management system


### 3. Data Analysis: 
- Explore the data to gain insights into the store's operations. Consider
performing queries, aggregations, and statistical analysis to uncover trends,
patterns, and key metrics.
- Analyze sales data to identify popular products, customer purchasing
behaviors, seasonal trends, etc.

```
Result
design and implement a database for an imaginary grocery store. The database should capture and organize various aspects of the store's operations, such as product inventory, customer information, orders, and sales data. Additionally, you will analyze the data and provide insights to support business decision-making.
Goals

The insight into the E-Commerce performance is shown in the dashboard report (USING POWER BI).
